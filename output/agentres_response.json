The patient has a diagnosis of Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis over time, but current lab values do not directly confirm the presence of established cirrhosis. The Albumin and INR have remained within normal limits throughout the reviewed period, suggesting preserved liver synthetic function.\n\n#### Audit & Review\n- Reviewed patient context, problem list, and medication history.\n- Examined laboratory results, focusing on LFTs, bilirubin, albumin, and INR across multiple encounters.\n- Analyzed the temporal relationship between medication use (Methotrexate) and LFT abnormalities.\n- Considered the underlying diagnosis of MASLD as a predisposing factor for liver injury.\n- Data source: ICE Laboratory System, Nervecentre EHR.\n\n---",
