No evidence of biliary obstruction or stones. Common bile duct measured at 5.1 mm. No focal lesions.       |\n| 2024-08-12  | CT Abdomen  | Liver       | CT-ABD-XYZ123 | Mild heterogeneous enhancement of the liver parenchyma. No focal lesions, masses, or significant biliary ductal dilatation identified. Mild hepatomegaly. |\n| 2024-11-10  | MRI Abdomen | Liver       | MRI-LVR-ABC789 | Liver demonstrates normal size and signal intensity. No focal lesions or suspicious masses. Biliary tree appears unremarkable. No ascites or splenomegaly. |\n\n#### Impression\n\nRadiological imaging, including ultrasound and CT, has been reviewed in the context of the patient's severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The findings indicate no evidence of biliary obstruction or structural abnormalities that would contraindicate recovery or suggest an alternative cause for the acute liver injury. The presence of mild hepatic steatosis is noted, consistent with underlying MASLD. The imaging does not reveal any findings suggestive of acute viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, or significant chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis or portal hypertension.\n\n#### Audit & Review\n\n*   Reviewed patient context, including primary diagnosis of severe DILI, medication history (specifically Methotrexate exposure), and laboratory findings.\n*   Radiology reports for CT Abdomen and Ultrasound Abdomen from 2024-08-12 were retrieved and analyzed. An additional MRI Abdomen from 2024-11-10 was also reviewed.\n*   Imaging findings were consistent with the established diagnosis of DILI and the presence of underlying MASLD, ruling out alternative structural causes for jaundice and elevated liver enzymes.\n*   Data source: FHIR DiagnosticReport endpoint (category LP29684-5) and associated imaging reports.\n*   Reviewed by Clinical Task Orchestrator.\n\n---",
