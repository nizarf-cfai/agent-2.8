Sarah Miller, a 43-year-old female with a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Essential Hypertension, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD/MASH), presented with jaundice and was found to have severe Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) secondary to Methotrexate, which was initiated for rheumatoid arthritis management approximately 10 weeks prior to presentation. Her peak ALT was 490 U/L and bilirubin peaked at 190 μmol/L. A liver ultrasound showed no biliary obstruction but did show findings suggestive of MASLD. Methotrexate was discontinued, and she was treated with N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA). What is the degree diagnosis according to EASL guideline for Sarah Miller?
