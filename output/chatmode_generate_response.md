#### Impression

The retrieved radiology reports for Sarah Miller, including abdominal ultrasound, CT, and MRI scans, indicate no structural abnormalities of the biliary tree or evidence of biliary obstruction. The findings are consistent with mild hepatic steatosis (MASLD) and do not reveal any focal hepatic lesions or masses. These imaging results align with a hepatocellular process rather than obstructive causes for her liver enzyme abnormalities.
